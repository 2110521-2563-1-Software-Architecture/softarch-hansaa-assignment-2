## 1. Graph showing the benchmarking results with the explanation of your experimental settings.

![Graph](https://github.com/2110521-2563-1-Software-Architecture/softarch-hansaa-assignment-2/blob/master/Image/Response%20Time%20(ms)%20of%20scenario%20a.png?raw=true)

## 2. Discussion of the results why one method is better the other in which scenarios. 

## 3. Comparison of the gRPC and REST API from the aspects of language neutral, ease of use, and performance.
Language neutral - gRPC has support by most popular languages and platforms but Rest has support from nearly every type of environment.
Ease of use - In side writing code, gRPC is simpler and faster to implement compared to REST.
Performance - In overrall performance, both servers are fairly simple.

## 4. Does your results comply with the results in https://medium.com/@bimeshde/grpc-vs-rest-performance-simplifiedfd35d01bbd4? How?
